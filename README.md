# Code Review

Code review written by [Sophie Wulff](https://github.com/sowulff).

1. `lists.php:20-22` - Try to use either <a> or <button>. They can't be combined.
2. `register.php` - maybe add a minimum of characters when choosing password by adding an if-statement.
3. `ists.php ` - Seems like the functionality for updating a list i there, just an edit-button missing!
4. `index.php` - Maybe when the user is logged in the homepage could show all lists or tasks for today ex.
5. `register.php` - Make the user repeat their password is an idea. For in cases like when the user misspells it when registering
6. `lists.php` - Since deleting lists is permanent you can add a window alert to your delete-button to prevent the user from deleting by mistake.
7. `profile.php` - right now the profile image the user uploaded dosen’t show on the page anywhere, solution would be to use img tag and print it!
8. `LICENCE` - don’t forgot to add the license in the license file.
9. `index.php` - Maybe add a welcome message when user is logged in.
10. `tasks.php` - Java script is going to be handy when dealing with the checkboxes in the task-file!

Overall you’ve done great so far in this Christmas projekt!
